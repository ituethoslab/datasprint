#Meeting minutes from research session on 31 March 2016. 

At Lab staff meeting it was agreed that each research project needs to present status to the Heads of Lab on 28-04-16. 
We need to figure out what will be in the presentation.

Still a lack of clarity about what the project is actually about amongst members. What are we studying? 
In the context of the research paper, whether datasprint can be called a digital method or not. But it's also relevant to discuss
whether we are trying to actually develop a standardized method, or whether we want to only discuss it from a more 
theoretical perspective. Not entirely clear yet, so therefore we will spend the next research session defining the problematic we are 
trying to answer. 

**Presentation elements:**

1. Powerpoint:

2. Literature: 
Spectrum running from the experimental social science understanding of method (eg. Jown Law) to the refined methods we see in 
Scrum, Agile, Kanban, Design Sprint, etc. 

3. Data:
Datasprints from 10 April and Watson Analytics. 

**Timeline:**

Thursday 07 April - Create problem statement for the project, delegate reading tasks. 

Thursday 14 April - Compare read material.  

Thursday 21 April - Create presentation

Thursday 28 April - Presentation
