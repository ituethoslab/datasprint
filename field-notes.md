**10:35(ish)**
Groups divide and start working. Both groups approach the datasprint in an apparently ad hoc manner, not structuring their work 
in any extended manner. This is unsurprising given that they are only 4 in each group. Team NJJ outline the following agenda:
1. Explore Data
2. Formulate Questions
3. Formulate hypothesis
4. Work
5. Win!

Team PG 
1. Explore and clean data
2. Look at data and find out what is interesting
3. Find out how to visualize data

**12:30**
Groups have been working for around two hours. Most started with Trifacta, but have now reached working with Watson. 
This tool is causing both of them some issues due to its constrained nature. 

**12:45**
Group PG is having big problems with Watson, both with figuring out how to use it and the program's relative ability to process the data 
they have. The tools is compared to Tableau (unfavourably) and is committed upon as a 'real black box'. 

**13:00-13:30**
Lunch and status. Both groups are postive about the whole datasprint, but slightly frustrated with Watson Analytics. It becomes clear that 
team NJJ have had more success using Trifacta than team PG have. The former have used it for data cleaning, whereas the latter has not used
it to any large extent and have actually experienced technical difficulties with the tool.
