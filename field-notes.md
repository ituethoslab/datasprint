**10:35(ish)**
Groups divide and start working. Both groups approach the datasprint in an apparently ad hoc manner, not structuring their work 
in any extended manner. This is unsurprising given that they are only 4 in each group. Team NJJ outline the following agenda:
- 1. Explore Data
- 2. Formulate Questions
- 3. Formulate hypothesis
- 4. Work
- 5. Win!

Team PG 's agenda was, roughly:
- 1. Explore and clean data
- 2. Look at data and find out what is interesting
- 3. Find out how to visualize data

**12:30**
Groups have been working for around two hours. Most started with Trifacta, but have now reached working with Watson. 
This tool is causing both of them some issues due to its constrained nature. 

**12:45**
Group PG is having big problems with Watson, both with figuring out how to use it and the program's relative ability to process the data 
they have. The tools is compared to Tableau (unfavourably) and is committed upon as a 'real black box'. 

**13:00-13:30**
Lunch and status. Both groups are postive about the whole datasprint, but slightly frustrated with Watson Analytics. It becomes clear that 
team NJJ have had more success using Trifacta than team PG have. The former have used it for data cleaning, whereas the latter has not used
it to any large extent and have actually experienced technical difficulties with the tool. 

**14:05**
Bastian from team PG comments that maybe the issue isn't Watson, as much of their own relative skill level. Jakob agrees, but adds 
that it would also help if it wasn't so slow. 

**14:10**
Team NJJ are listening to tutorials for using the tools. 

**14:20**
Team PG comment that it's about time to decide and start working on a concrete project.

**14:28**
Team PG have started to look for the options for creating dashboards in Watson. 

**14:50**
Comment to the prospect of studying the datasprint: Very difficult to figure out how to study without intervening too much. Based on previous datasprints, we can perhaps start to conclude that being part of the datasprint and studying it at the same time is extremely difficult. More testing is needed, and I am sure that there is a lot to learn from previous efforts at participant observation/ethnographic studies of science and technology processes. 

**15:00**
Tiemo from NJJ comments that Watson isn't so intuitive for creating visualizations as he had thought it would be. Nicolai agreed. They agree to start watching a tutorial video on visualization/assembling data, as they reckon it may be their own skills that are missing. 

**15:09**
Tiemo and Pedro discuss Watson, commenting on how it is very restrictive - if you know a little about data etc. Watson does not let you do precisely what you want, while if you know nothing but just want to get simple results then it is probably very efficient. 
Meta-comment: Does this session work as a datasprint? Well, it is interesting to not that it is generating a lot of discussion of and - hopefully - insight into the tools at hand. This raises a question however: how is this different from just being a couple of friends sitting in one's apartment and trying out a data-tool? What makes it into a datasprint? We have various answers, most of which aren't represented in this datasprint: Involvement of an expert who knows the reality captured by the data, output of knowledge in the form of a report, etc. or a relatively strict and paced way of organising the work. 

**15:44**
Team NJJ have given up on working with the twitter data, and are now working with the titanic dataset instead. They are making much more progress with coming up with research questions etc. Part of the reason they had to abandon using twitter was the way the hashtags were structured in the data from twitter. This brought up a discussion between myself and Pedro about how this sort of data visualization forces you to think about what you are interested in: To use the hashtag data you have to very consciously reform a big part of the data, which can be quite difficult. This was an interesting take-away for Pedro in terms of the Navigating Complexity course, and what we are teaching them there. 

**15:53**
Team PG are in the process of creating an assembly of their data, and seem to have come to terms with Watson a lot more than they were earlier. 

**16:16**
Tiemo's feedback for Watson: Predictive modelling goes very fast. But it seems technically faulty. Half of team NJJ have to leave, due to other obligations. They send the following result:
