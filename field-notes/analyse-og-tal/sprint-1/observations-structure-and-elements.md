#Observations on the effects of the structure and elements on the datasprint. Made by Michael.   

Meta-comments:  
9 people present, including Malte.  
Majority late, Bastian, Kristian and Nicolai on time.  

Copy of the agenda, in order to structure observations around this:  

10:00 - Welcome by Michael Hockenhull, ETHOS Lab
Brief presentation: welcome, agenda, agenda of other datasprints. Jakob suggests that we start the data collection before lunch, rather than after.  

10:30 - Introduction to the student housing situation by Malte Moll Wingender, Analyse og Tal
Presentation by Malte: Sociologist from UCPH. Works with traditional methods (surveys, registrational data), started survey two weeks ago, have around 3.500 replies. Will probably end up with 5.000 replies in total. Distributing through a facebook link and through e-mail to an already existing link. Respondents are from the whole country.    
Will explain about the background and scope of the project;  
4 critical issues:  
- Enrollment in University is increasing heavily. One good reason for needing more good housing.  
- Elder generations are very large, and they are looking for the same type of accommodation as students.  
- Many apartments are being renovated and smaller ones are joined together into a big one. So getting less small apartements.
- Prices are increasing heavily, which is the major issue for students.  
The situation is really bad for finding good accommodation for students and the elderly. How can we put pressure on politicians to build more of this type of construction?  

Major objectives:  
- Provide knowledge for construction companies in terms of accommodation size, placement, affordable and overall attractive.  
      Since this is very difficult to do due to price constraints, how do we make it more attractive to move places outside of CPH?  
      Do students need a parking lot? Do they need a garden?  
- By showing a lot of data that support that this is a problem, they wish to put pressure on the politicians.   
      Michael: How to communicate this to politicians? A&T only providing data and report, and then Danish Youth Council will supply     debates, publish articles, reader letters.  

Jakob: What is Malte's take on the change from 20% to 10% social housing 'alment byggeri', why is it happening and who is our opponent? Malte; it's all about the money basically, because companies want to earn more by building expensive housing.  

Tiemo: So we are basically interested in figuring out student preferences?   
Malte: Yeah, and some companies are doing this; KAB for example.  
Michael: So basically we need to either get more data to support that this is an issue OR look into student preferences. 
Malte: Yeah, but other perspectives could also be interesting - the elderly, collegiums, etc. Also interesting to look into whether students like social vs. private living. 

Meta-comment; much notetaking by Bastian, Nikolai and Michael. Others are mainly listening. 

11:00 - Data collection brainstorm & Setting Data Collection Teams

Research Design Brainstorm:  
Malte: Of other topics, waiting lists, international students and comparisons would be very interesting.  

Tentative RD: "How is the housing situation discussed on Facebook?"  
Tentative RD: "How is the housing situation discussed online?"  
Tentative RD: "How is the housing situation discussed online in the Nordic countries?"  
Tentative RD: "How is the housing situation discussed online in Denmark, and in comparison to the Nordic countries?"  
Tentative RD: "How are the challenges faced by students in Denmark enacted online, and in comparison to other Scandinavian countries?"  
Tentative RD: "How are the challenges faced by students in Denmark enacted on different online platforms, potentially in comparison to other Scandinavian countries?"  


Data Collection Brainstorm:  
- Tiemo: On Facebook there is a lot of groups or posts about getting housing, getting free stuff.  
- Jakob: All sorts of initiatives that help students survive; could give insight into what students need. Compare between Sweden, Norway or other countries (via Facebook).  
- Michael: Maybe Instagram might be useful?
- Bastian: Maps. 
- Michael: KKIK waiting list. 

Group brainstorm results;  
Jakob, Bastian, Susan, Nicolai - Looked at housing portals, which can and should be scraped, but which will mostly tell us something about the supply of housing. Try to find a portal that has an overview of the different postings, and then scrape those sites continously to get an impression of the demand for housing.  
Jakob looked at his Facebook media database, and found 3.200 stories about housing.  
Being cheated is a big theme in the housing situation.  

Tiemo, Kristian, Cæcilie, Michael, Malte - Tiemo suggests that we could scrape data on housing offers and then calculate the average prices for a typical student accommodation, in order to compare it with the government's standards.  
Michael; we talked about maps, and scraping data from the positions of kollegiums.  

**Setting Data Collection Teams:**  

Facebook  
Tiemo, Susan    

Instagram  
Kristian, Michael

Web Scraping  
Jakob, Bastian, Pedro  

Mapping Group  
Nicolai, Cæcilie 

Everyone will look at the data available, and then we will decide what to work with.
