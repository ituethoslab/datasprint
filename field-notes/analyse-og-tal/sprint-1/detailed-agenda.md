#Agenda for the 1st A&T datasprint. 

10:00 - Welcome by Michael Hockenhull, ETHOS Lab  
A short introduction to today's programme, thanks to A&T and to all participants for coming.    
Also give an introduction to the other, upcoming, days and underline that the themes are obviously constructions.  
Also a buffer for the people who will be late. 

10:30 - Introduction to the student housing situation by Malte Moll Wingender, Analyse og Tal  
Malte has asked for 20 minutes, but 10 more for questions seems optimal.   
A presentation on the research they have done so far, the case, etc. 

11:00 - Data collection brainstorm  
With the knowledge we have gotten from Malte, and what we have ourselves, we should brainstorm different ways of getting data.  
Should we also discuss the overall research design?  

11:30 - Setting Data Collection Teams  
With some themes brainstormed, we should divide into teams that work with different topics.  
I presume there will be at least one with social media and one with websites like dba.dk.  
Should these teams have role divisions?  
Perhaps each group selects a leader to be in charge of reporting and steering the group?

12:00 - Lunch  
Where do we get this from?
