#This file is a draft for the e-mail inviting everyone to the series of datasprints, with emphasis on the first one. 

Topic: Invitation to Datasprint w. Analyse & Tal

Dear all, 

You are hereby invited to ETHOS Lab's next datasprint, to be held on Sunday the 10th of April, from 10:00 to 16:00. This sprint will be 
the first in a series of three to be held together with Analyse og Tal (ogtal.dk), the lab's first official partner organisation. 
The sprint will take place in ETHOS Lab. To sign-up for the datasprint, please sign-up here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x19_0-fZX6Eb_EF_ZfqF-ZIyupH75lwxC0YQW3-4kw8/viewform).

All three datasprints will have the same theme: We are partnering with Analyse & Tal to use digital methods to gain an 
**understanding of the housing conditions of students in larger cities in Denmark.** This is in an extension of a research project 
that Analyse & Tal is doing for the Danish Student Council. I expect that we will use social media data (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) 
but that we will also potentially scrape data online or use more traditional sources.

Each datasprint will focus on different sub-tasks related to the overall goal:

10/04-16: The 1st sprint will be used to introduce us to the issue we are investigating and to design and start data collection. Analyse & Tal will
introduce us to the research they have done thus far, so we don't reinvent the wheel. 

The 2nd sprint will focus on analysing the data we will have collected by then.

Finally, the 3rd sprint will focus on how to present the findings of the analyses done previously. 

Dates for the two next sprints will be sent out as soon as we have them.

Best regards, 
Michael
